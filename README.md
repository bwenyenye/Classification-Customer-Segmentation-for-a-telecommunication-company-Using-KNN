# Classification-Customer-Segmentation-for-a-telecommunication-company-Using-KNN
## About the project
This project aims to predict the category of customers in a telecommunication company using a K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm.
The project focuses on using demographic data such as age, income and marital status to predict the target field called **custcat**.
The custcat column has four possible values corresponding to the following categories:
* 1- Basic Service
* 2- E-Service
* 3- Plus Service
* 4- Total Service

The objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. I will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.

## Prerequisites
I have used the following libraries and dependencies in this project:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikitlearn
* preprocessing
* metrics
* train_test_split
* KNeighborsClassifier

## The Dataset
The dataset is obtained from the IBM Object storage [here](/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/data/teleCust1000t.csv).
The dataset has 12 columns with 1000 rows of data as follows:
* region	
* tenure
* age
* marital
* address
* income
* ed	
* employ
* retire
* gender
* reside
* custcat

I used the following demographic columns as the feature sets:
* region	
* tenure
* age
* marital
* address
* income
* ed	
* employ
* retire
* gender
* reside
The target in this project was the following column:
* custcat



The dataset was clean and correctly encoded.
